Python provides two levels of access to network services. 
At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

Following the steps below will enable you to connect to a network in python.

Step 1: First import the required libraries.
Step 2: Then  scan and display all the available SSIDs using the cmd commands and a Python library known as OS.
Step 3: Next, select the known Wi-Fi network to connect to and wait until it connects successfully.
